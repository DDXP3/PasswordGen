# PassGen

## Password Generating with JavaScript

In this project, the goal was to make a system to generate a password with 8 to 128 characters while still having the option of choosing they type of characters that the user wants.

- my motive was to make a password generater with JavaScript. I could use this for future projects.

## Usage

This password generating code can be used for websites that wants to generate a password. It's also very user friendly.
